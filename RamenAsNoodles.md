# Ramen, as Noodles

Recipe Originally based on what my mom made for me as a kid.

## Ingredients:

- 1 Pack of Preferred Ramen Noodle Pack. (I recommend Maruchan Roast Chicken or Maruchan Mushroom Chicken)
- 1/2 tbsp Butter (For Noodles)
- Optional: Chili Oil
- Optional: 1/2 tbsp Butter (For Optional Stuff)
- Optional: Corn (However much you want, I usually use about 1/3 of a can.)
- Optional: Onion
- Optional: 12oz Can of Chunked Chicken (I use Kirkland brand)
- Optional For Chicken: Onion Powder
- Optional For Chicken: Garlic Powder
- Optional For Chicken: Ginger Powder
- Optional: 1 Egg

## Directions

You should probably do each of the following simultaneously.

### Noodle Prep

This is pretty easy, just bring 2 cups of water (or really however much you need to submerge your ramen) to a boil. Place the noodles portion of your packet in. When the noodles are to an enjoyable tenderness, pull them and drain. I like them relatively soft, so I wait until I can see some color of the wooden spoon I use to stir them about through them.

Next put your butten back in the pot you used to boil the ramen, and let it melt a bit (optionally, put a little bit of chili oil in now as well, however much you'd like, start small!), then place the noodles back in, and apply the seasoning packet. Mix well. Now you're ready to go to plating if you didn't touch the optional components.

### Optional Component Prep

In a bowl, crack an egg, season with salt and pepper, stir thoroughly in preparation for scramble.

If using Chicken, and wanting to be fancy, In a small vessel, prep equal amounts Garlic, Onion, and Ginger Powder, you want maybe 1 or 2 tsbp worth of this stuff imo.

Put your butter and/or chili oil in a pan. Put it on high, I like to develop some color on this mix, but you can go lower and develop less!

Once hot, throw on your veg. Frozen should go first. One those start to develop, drop some drained canned chicken and let that sizzle for a bit, but then constinuously stir, don't let anything burn, you just want color.

Once you're about sasisfied, make a divot in your pan of food, and put your egg in, cook as if scrambling, and when about ready, mix it in with the rest. Then you're done!

### Final Plating

Literally put them in the same vessel and stir. Then dump it in a bowl or on a plate and eat it up. It's good!
