#Chocolate Chip & Walnut Cookies

Recipe Originally based on Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe

## Ingredients:
    2 1/4 Cups all-purpose Flour
    1/2 tsp. baking soda (I should note I technically used a pinch or so more than 1/2 tsp. I'll not do that again though.)
    1/2 tsp. baking powder
    1 tsp. salt
    1 cup (sticks) butter, melted (I used the stove)
    3/4 cup granulated sugar
    3/4 cup brown sugar
    1 tsp. vanilla extract
    2 large eggs
    2 cups (12 oz) Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips (or morsels, whatever, you do you, live your best life)
    1 cup chopped Walnuts. (The original recipe says if you don't add nuts, you should add 1 to 2 Tbsp. of all-purpose flour)

## Directions:
    ### Section 1:
        - Preheat Oven to 375 Degrees Farentheight
        - In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt
        - In a large mixing bowl, beat butter , granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until creamy
        
    ### Section 2:
        - Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
        - Beat in flour mixture gradually.
        - Stir in morsels and nuts

    ### Section 3:
        - Drop onto ungreased baking sheets by ice cream scoop (Use whatever you like). 
        - Pinch of (ideally large-grain Kosher) salt on each cookie.
        - Bake for 9 to 11 minutes or until golden brown. 
        - Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes.
        - Remove to wire racks to cool completely.
