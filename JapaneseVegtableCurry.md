# Japanese Vegtable Curry

This basically just the Vermont Curry recipe, but with a few extra steps, and being a little more loosey goosey with amounts.

## Ingredients:

- 1 Large White Onion (or more, the box says ~2lbs)
- 1lb Yukon Gold Potatoes
- 1lb Carrots
- 1/2lb Baby Bella Mushrooms
- 1 Can Chickpeas
- 1 Can Corn
- 1 Bag Frozen Peas
- However much Garlic you want
- Several boxes of Vermont Curry, MED HOT
- Better than Bouillon Vegetable Base
- Olive Oil
- Salt
- Pepper

## Directions

So before we start, you should know that the goal in the end is to get a big pot of curry, and to do that there's going to be a simmering in soupy broth step to soften the veg (in particular the potatoes and carrots), followed by thickening with the Vermont Curry bricks cubed up. I haven't mastered the whole "writing a recipe in a series of steps" thing, so trying to explain how to do everything in parallel to get to that simmering step in an optimal way elludes me, as I fail to do it myself. So just keep in mind that at some point a bunch of these things need to be simmered in the pot at the same time until they're soft. You can do all of the veg prep first if you want before the final simmer, just know it probably won't be optimally fast.

So typically for this I use a 7 quart cast iron dutch oven, along with some sort of pan to do additional work. As mentioned above, you can just do everything in batches in your big pot up until the final simmer and be fine, it'll just take longer.

#### Prepare Onion

About half your onions should be roughly chopped, leaving long strips of onion, with the other half given a finer chop (though no need to dice). These can all be sauted together with Olive Oil and salt until translucent.

#### Prepare Mushrooms

Make sure your mushrooms are sliced. Then saute with a bit of olive oil and salt until you get some nice color, typically takes at least ~10 minutes.

#### Prepare Carrots

Peel and then either do a rough chop, or put into rounds. I like to then saute for a bit with Olive Oil, if you're sauteing the Onions and/or the Mushrooms in the final vessel, they can go in with those. Make sure to do a light season with Salt and Pepper.

#### Prepare Potatoes

I like to do a rough chops of these, getting them roughly into 1/2" - 1" pieces, but anywhere around that would be fine. Once they're chopped they're ready for the simmer step.

#### Prepare Garlic

This should be the absolute last thing before you cover with water/broth and start to simmer. Finely dice as much garlic as you'd like, saute it until fragrent and starting to turn brown. You should be ready to dump in all of your ingrediants and water in so you can prevent the garlic from burning.

#### Simmer

Place everything into your final vessel, cover with a mixture of water and better than bouillon vegetable base, and bring to a boil. Drop down to a simmer.

#### Rinse Corn and Chickpeas

I just dump my cans of corn and chickpeas into a strainer and rinse them. From there they can go into the final mix towards the end of the simmer.

#### Curry and Season

When your Potatoes are easily piereced with a fork or knife. Either remove from heat, or turn the heat very low. Proceed to chop curry blocks and mix into your vessel. I typically use 2 boxes for nearly 7 quarts of curry, but you might use more or less. Ultimately you'll mix in until you're satisfied with the thickness of your curry. From here you can season it with additional salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste. 

#### Frozen Peas

This is the time for your peas, it will also bring the temperture down to make it easier to serve. If you don't like peas, you could use frozen corn instead.
